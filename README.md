## About me

I am 27 years old, although I still feel young 🫣

It's been 2 years since I call Brussels _my home_.

I became interested in Front-end because I have had human interaction for too long which was tiring me and I just want to move on being _introverted_ for a while. I have always had a passion about computer and self-learned a lot of things.
