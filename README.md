## About me

I am 27 years old, although I still feel young ðŸ«£

It's been 2 years since I call Brussels _my home_.

I became interested in Front-end because I have had human interaction for too long which was tiring me and I just want to move on being _introverted_ for a while. I have always had a passion about computer and self-learned a lot of things.

### Hobbies

- Trying new foods in new countries
- Eating
- Singing
- Cooking, but only the things I like
- Walking
- Watching movies

### Languages

- Romanian - native
- English - fluent
- Russian - fluent
- Italian - conversational
- French - conversational

### Pet peeve

- I can listen to a song on repeat for days, or, if I like it too much, for
weeks
